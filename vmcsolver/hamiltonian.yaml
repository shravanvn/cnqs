# Hamiltonian is given by
#
#   H = - \frac{h}{2} \sum_{j = 1}^d \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_j^2}
#       + 2 \sum_{(j, k) \in E} \beta_{jk} * (1 - \cos(\theta_j - \theta_k))
#
# In network specifications, edges are specified by the boundary nodes (j, k)
# and interaction strength \beta_jk
#
# The following specification represents the graph:
#
#   0 - 1
#

num_rotor: 2

h: 5.0

edges:
- j: 0
  k: 1
  beta: 1.0
