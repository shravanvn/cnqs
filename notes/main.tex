\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Let $(\CV, \CE)$ be an undirected graph with vertex set $\CV = \{1, \ldots,
d\}$ for some $d \geq 2$ and edge set $\CE \subseteq \{(j, k) \in \CV \times
\CV : j \neq k\}$ (i.e.\ we don't consider graphs with self-loops). We can
envision a system of quantum rotors on this graph, where the vertices
correspond to the rotors, and the edges define some interaction between the
rotors. The Hamiltonian of such a system may be written as
\begin{equation}
  H = - \frac{1}{2} \Laplacian - \sum_{(j, k) \in \CE} g_{jk} \cos(\theta_j -
  \theta_k)
\end{equation}
Our goal is to find a solution of the associated Schrodinger equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:schrodinger}
  H \psi(\Vec{x}) = \lambda \psi(\Vec{x})
\end{equation}
that has the minimum energy. We shall restrict ourselves to only the
wavefunctions $\psi \in \SL^1([0, 2\pi]^d)$ and their weak derivatives satisfy
periodic boundary conditions.

\subsection{Reformulation Using Fourier Series}

Since $\psi$ is $2\pi$-periodic along each of the dimensions, we can express it
in terms of the Fourier series
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fourier}
  \psi(\Vec{x}) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^d} \sum_{\Vec{\omega} \in \DZ^d}
  \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega}) \exp(\I \Vec{\omega} \cdot \Vec{\theta})
\end{equation}
where ``$\,\cdot\,$'' is the standard inner product in $\DR^d$ and the Fourier
coefficients are given by
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega}) := \int_{[0, 2\pi]^d} \psi(\Vec{\theta}) \exp(-\I
  \Vec{\omega} \cdot \Vec{\theta}) \D{\Vec{\theta}}
\end{equation}
Now, substituting \eqref{eq:fourier} in \eqref{eq:schrodinger}, multiplying by
$\exp(\I \Vec{\omega} \cdot \Vec{\theta})$ and integrating over all space, we
obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fourier-eigenstate}
  \Norm{\Vec{\omega}}^2 \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega}) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(j, k) \in
  \CE} g_{jk} [\hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega} + \Vec{e}_j - \Vec{e}_k) +
  \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega} - \Vec{e}_j + \Vec{e}_k)] = \lambda
  \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega})
\end{equation}
where $\Vec{e}_j$ is the vector of all zeros except at the $j$-th entry, which
is $1$. Clearly, \eqref{eq:fourier-eigenstate} is an eigenvalue equation for
the Fourier coefficients $\hat{\psi}$ w.r.t.\ the operator $\hat{H}$ defined as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega}) := \Norm{\Vec{\omega}}^2
  \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega}) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(j, k) \in \CE} g_{jk}
  [\hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega} + \Vec{e}_j - \Vec{e}_k) + \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega} -
  \Vec{e}_j + \Vec{e}_k)]
\end{equation}
Note that given $\psi \in \SL^1([0, 2\pi]^d)$ with peridic weak derivatives,
the Fourier coefficients $\hat{\psi} \in \SL^2(\DZ^d)$ satisfy a fast decay
condition
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{\Vec{\omega} \in \DZ^d} \Norm{\Vec{\omega}}^2
  \Abs{\hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega})} < \infty
\end{equation}

\section{Overview of Algorithms for Finding Extremal Eigenpairs}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

In a separable Hilbert space $\CH$, let $A : \CH \to \CH$ be non-zero, positive
semi-definite, compact, Hermitian. We want to find it is maximal eigenpair. The
existence of the maximal eigenpair for $A$ follows from the spectral theorem.

\subsection{Connection to Our Problem}

In our problem, we can easily establish a lower bound for the minimal eigevalue
of our Hamiltonian $H$; it is given by
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_\text{min}(H) \geq \mu = -\sum_{(j, k) \in \CE} \Abs{g_{jk}}
\end{equation}
It turns out that the operator $A = (H - \mu I)^{-1}$ is non-zero, positive
semi-definite, compact (?) and Hermitian. Additionally, our space of functions
$\SL^1([0, 2\pi]^d)$ is a Hilbert space and is separable with the Fourier basis
\begin{equation}
  \left\{e^{\I \Vec{\omega} \cdot \Vec{\theta}} : \Vec{\omega} \in \DZ^d\right\}
\end{equation}
Thus, we can find the maximal eigenpair of the operator $A$, which corresponds
to the minimal eigenpair of the Hamiltonian $H$.

\subsection{Power Iteration}

Given an arbitrary state $\psi_0$, consider the sequence $\psi_\ell$ and
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{\ell + 1} = \frac{A \psi_\ell}{\Norm[\CH]{A \psi_\ell}}, \quad
  \lambda_{\ell + 1} = \InProd[\CH]{\psi_{\ell + 1}}{A \psi_{\ell + 1}}
\end{equation}
Now provided
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The maximal eigenpair is unique
  \item
    Initial state $\psi_0$ is not orthogonal to the eigenstate of the maximal
    eigenpair
\end{enumerate}
the power iteration converges to the maximal eigenpair. When we apply this
approach to $A = (H - \mu I)^{-1}$ to find the minimal eigenpair of $H$, this
algorithm is called the inverse power iteration.

\subsection{Rayleigh Quotient Iteration}

Rayleigh quotient iteration improves the convergence of the inverse power
iteration by updating the $\mu$ value at each iteration: starting from $\mu_0 =
\mu$ we generate the next states as
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{\ell + 1} = \frac{(H - \mu_\ell I)^{-1} \psi_\ell}{\Norm[\CH]{(H -
  \mu_\ell I)^{-1} \psi_\ell}}, \quad \mu_{\ell + 1} =
  \frac{\InProd[\CH]{\psi_{\ell + 1}}{H \psi_{\ell +
  1}}}{\InProd[\CH]{\psi_{\ell + 1}}{\psi_{\ell + 1}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Projected Gradient Descent}

Finding the smallest eigenpair of $H$ can also be found by minimizing the
Rayleigh quotient. This is equivalent to solving the optimization problem
\begin{equation}
  \text{minimize} \quad \InProd[\CH]{\psi}{H \psi} \quad \text{subject to}
  \quad \Norm[\CH]{\psi} = 1
\end{equation}

\section{Numerical Solution Schemes}

All the algorithms outlined in the section above only require either applying
shifted Hamiltonian inverse $(H - \mu I)^{-1}\psi$ (i.e.\ solving the linear
system $(H - \mu I) \tilde{\psi} = \psi$) or computing the operator application
$H \psi$. Now, we outline a few different ways to actually implement this
operator application numerically.

\subsection{Finite Difference Scheme}

We discretize the quantum state $\psi$ on a uniform grid in the domain $[0,
2\pi]^d$ with $n$ points per dimension (technically, $n + 1$ points per
dimension, but the first and last points are the same due to periodicity). This
creates a $d$-dimensional $n \times \cdots \times n$ tensor discretization of
the state---we denote it as $\uppsi$.

Evaluating the discretization of $H \psi$ is straightforward provided we use
some finite difference scheme for the derivatives. For instance, we can use the
five-point finite difference stencil to approximate
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \theta_j^2}(\Vec{i} h) \approx
  \frac{-\uppsi(\Vec{i}_j^{(+2)}) + 16 \uppsi(\Vec{i}_j^{(+1)}) - 30
  \uppsi(\Vec{i}) + 16 \uppsi(\Vec{i}_j^{(-1)}) - \uppsi(\Vec{i}_j^{(-2)})}{12
  h^2}
\end{equation}
where we denote $\Vec{i} h = (i_1 h, \ldots, i_d h)$, $\Vec{i} = (i_1, \ldots,
i_d)$, and
\begin{equation}
  \Vec{i}_j^{(\pm k)} = (i_1, \ldots, i_{j - 1}, i_j^{(\pm k)}, i_{j + 1},
  \ldots, i_d), \quad i_j^{(\pm k)} = (i_j \pm k) \mod (n)
\end{equation}
with $0 \leq i_j < n$, $h = 2 \pi / n$. With this, we can now compute a
discretization of $(H - \mu I) \psi$ with fourth order accuracy very easily,
which in turn allows us to solve the system
\begin{equation}
  (H - \mu I) \widetilde{\psi}_{\ell + 1} = \psi_{\ell}
\end{equation}
using, for example, the conjugate gradient (CG) iterative method.

\subsection{Fourier Spectral Scheme}

Here we consider the Fourier reformulation of our problem. It is easy to see
that if $\hat{\psi}$ is a real-valued function, then so is $\hat{H}
\hat{\psi}$. To take advantage of this property, we start with the initial
state
\begin{equation}
  \psi^{(0)}(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_d) = \cos(\theta_1) \cdots \cos(\theta_d)
\end{equation}
The corresponding Fourier coefficients are given by
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\psi}^{(0)}(k_1, \ldots, k_d) =
  \begin{cases}
    \pi^d & \text{if} \quad \Abs{k_1} = \cdots = \Abs{k_d} = 1 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Now due to the fast decay condition of the Fourier coefficients $\hat{\psi}$,
we can choose to compute $\hat{\psi}$ at the integer lattice points inside
$[-k_\text{max}, k_\text{max}]^d$ and assume the Fourier coefficients to be
zero outside this domain, without incurring too much error. We can now easily
evaluate $\hat{H} \hat{\psi}$, and consequently solve the linear system
$(\hat{H} - \mu \hat{I}) \hat{\phi} = \hat{\psi}_\ell$ using iterative methods.
To accelerate convergence of these iterative solvers, we devise a
preconditioner
\begin{equation}
  \hat{M} \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega}) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \Norm{\Vec{\omega}}^2 -
  \mu\right)^{1/2} \hat{\psi}(\Vec{\omega})
\end{equation}
and solve the preconditioned linear system
\begin{equation}
  \hat{M}^{-1} \Hat{H} \Hat{M}^{-1} \hat{M} \hat{\phi} = \hat{M}^{-1}
  \hat{\psi}
\end{equation}
Note that due to the symmetric nature of the preconditioning, we can still use
the iterative CG solver.

\section{Numerical Results}

  $\Ord(n^{3.125835})$.}
  \label{fig:2d-basic-self-convergence-analysis}
\end{figure}

We performed a self-convergence analysis with this basic scheme in $d = 2$
dimensions with edge set $\CE = \{(1, 2)\}$ and $n = 8, 16, 32, \ldots, 1024$
uniform discretization points per dimension. We started our power iteration
with initial state
\begin{equation}
  \psi^{(0)}(\theta_1, \theta_2) = \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
\end{equation}
which is the lowest energy eigenstate corresponding to the Laplacian part of
the Hamiltonian. We set both the CG iteration and inverse power iteration
tolerances to $\tau_\text{cg} = \tau_\text{inv} = 10^{-6}$ --- the power
iteration is stopped when we get $\Abs{\lambda^{(\ell + 1)} - \lambda^{(\ell)}}
< \tau_\text{inv}$. In our example, it took 9 power iterations until
convergence to the minimal eigenstate at all discretization levels. Using the
$n = 1024$ discretization solution as the reference the lowest energy turns out
to be $\lambda_\text{min} \approx -0.378$. In
Figure~\ref{fig:2d-basic-self-convergence-analysis} we plot the errors of the
other discretization levels using this reference solution. The error decays
approximately as $\Ord(n^{-3.990829})$ as we increase the level of
discretization with our fourth order differentiation scheme. In the same
figure, we see that the number of total CG iterations increase approximately as
$\Ord(n^{0.982632})$, but the cost of each individual iteration increases as
$\Ord(n^2)$. The empirical overall cost of estimating the lowest energy
eigenstate increases as $\Ord(n^{3.125835})$.

  difference in eigenvalue estimates using $k_\text{max} = 7$ and $k_\text{max}
  = 8$. The error plot clearly shows spectral convergence of the Fourier
  scheme. Also note that the average number of CG iterations per power
  iterations plateaus very quickly.}

  network with $\CV = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $\CE = \{(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5),

  error in minimal eigenvalue estimates were computed using the $k_\text{max} =

  of the Fourier scheme. Also note that the average number of CG iterations per
  power iterations plateaus very quickly.}
  \label{fig:5d-fourier-self-convergence-analysis}
\end{figure}

We performed a self-convergence analysis using this Fourier scheme with exactly
the same setting as before. In implementing the CG iterations, we used the
preconditioner
\begin{equation}
  M_\mu \hat{\psi}(\Vec{k}) := \frac{g J}{2} \Norm{\Vec{k}}^2 \hat{\psi}(\Vec{k}) - \mu \hat{\psi}(\Vec{k})
\end{equation}
in solving linear system $(\hat{H} - \mu I) \widetilde{\psi}^{(\ell + 1)} =
\hat{\psi}^{(\ell)}$. In Figure~\ref{fig:2d-fourier-self-convergence-solution}
we can clearly see that the high-amplitude modes are contained within the
low-frequency domain. This leads to spectral convergence of our scheme, as
demonstrated in Figures~\ref{fig:2d-fourier-self-convergence-analysis}
and~\ref{fig:5d-fourier-self-convergence-analysis}. This leads to very few
conjugate gradient steps (all the linear solves converged within 8 iterations).
In the same figure we plot the total number of CG iterations and elapsed time
till convergence as we increase the discretization parameter $k_\text{max}$ ---
we see that the number of iterations plateaus very quickly.

\subsection{Performance of the Fourier Scheme}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/2d_fourier_performance_analysis.pdf}

  were conducted with $k_\text{max} = 2$, and the error in minimum eigenvalue
  was computed with the solution with $k_\text{max} = 3$ as the reference
  solution.}
  \label{fig:2d-fourier-performance-analysis}
\end{figure}

We also tested the performance of the periodic scheme by solving the problem
for increasing number of rotors $d$. We used $k_\text{max} = 2$ for our
simulations, and used the $k_\text{max} = 3$ solution as the reference to
compute the error. In all simulations, the edge sets were set to
\begin{equation}
  \CE = \{(1, 2), (1, 3), \ldots, (1, d)\}
\end{equation}
In Figure~\ref{fig:2d-fourier-performance-analysis} we plot the error in the
minimal eigenvalue, number of power iterations, number of CG iterations per
power iteration and elapsed time per CG iteration.

We note that our algorithm is easily parallelizable, both with the basic and
Fourier schemes, and using either distributed or shared memory frameworks. We
implemented a basic parallel code utilizing OpenMP. In this framework, we
solved a problem with $d = 7$ quantum rotors and discretization level
$k_\text{max} = 8$ using the Fourier scheme. The edges between the rotors were
distributed as in Figure~\ref{fig:quantum-rotor-network}. In
Table~\ref{tab:strong-scaling} we present the results from the strong scaling.
